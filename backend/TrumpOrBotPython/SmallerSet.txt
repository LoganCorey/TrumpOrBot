Congress is back.TIME TO CUT CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained.
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUTCAP and BALANCE.
THe Art of the Deal--"The best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have." CUT CAP and BALANCE.
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency.

Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk?
@johnboehner  @EricCantor  "You can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods people will eventually catch on." - The Art of the Deal
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?

The Democrats in the Super Committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks. Huge mistake. Cut wasteful spending first.
Our national debt has grown by 30% and a gallon of gas has doubled so far under @BarackObama. He is a disaster.
@BarackObama now says  that he is an "underdog in 2012." America should be so lucky. We still need a solid candidate.
@BarackObama sold guns to the Mexican drug cartels.  They were used in the murders of Americans . Where is the outrage?
China is threatening Washington over the currency bill.  We should pass it immediately.
Washington is wasting over $2 billion this year on Solyndra type loans. Yet they want to cut military spending.

Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security.
The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.
Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy not a friend.
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.

The US government's foreign debt is at a record $5.29T http://t.co/URVNZ1Kj  China is laughing all the way to the bank.
US government's foreign indebtedness has grown over 72% under @BarackObama. He is bleeding us dry to China.
If @BarackObama really loved this country he wouldn't be destroying it. He has ruined our credit and killed jobs with ObamaCare.
Congratulations to @bobmcdonnell on leading Virginia to be in the black for a 3rd straight year. He is a fantastic governor.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM--tune in!

Americans already believe that @PaulRyanVP is better qualified to serve as  President over @JoeBiden  http://t.co/Ankpt5Uj   No surprise.
Scary thought--@JoeBiden is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Unemployment is up in 44 states showing July's unemployment numbers to be broad based  http://t.co/mgeJGq2e @BarackObama is a job killer.

Only three weeks until the new season of @CelebApprentice begins filming--great all-star cast.

Many people will be surprised at what is about to be released concerning @BarackObama's background. I for one won't be.

Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico. @BarackObama can't be bothered he is too concerned with @MittRomney's taxes.
We are about to have a record $500B trade deficit with the Chinese this year. That money should be back here financing jobs in America.
Congratulations to @Yankees Derek Jeter on passing Eddie Murray last night to become the 11th all-time @MLB hit leader.

Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend. He was an American hero.

China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama  http://t.co/mV75eJFy  Of course. Mitt knows it's Time To Get Tough.
I was putting together my early deals in New York &amp; I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself &amp; you can do anything.
It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?
Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden  http://t.co/UkCnZrrJ

Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year.
Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better.

The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!
"After four  years of getting the run-around America needs a turnaround and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney." @PaulRyanVP
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
Too busy playing golf? @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic  signature to the parents of fallen SEALs   http://t.co/ELKcqTyr
Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment.
Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it.
A fact--golfers don't get aches &amp; pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial.
It's Friday how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today?

Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report.
Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
Is this Hope &amp; Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs &amp; trade during @BarackObama's term.
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.

North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte.
Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136260 per household a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts etc.

Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.
The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years." Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip http://t.co/T5xzkNuL  They have zero respect for us. Outrageous!

Drew Peterson a real sleaze just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty.
Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88921000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
There are now 119000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.
Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force &amp; have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery phony numbers
This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is: http://t.co/NY3DQGrT   Disaster.
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%
A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence go with your gut!
During @BarackObama's presidency median family income has fallen 4.8% http://t.co/OqAgfiQ7  Terrible for the middle class.

The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers &amp; their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
84% of US troops wounded &amp; 70% of our brave men &amp; women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?

It's Wednesday how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?
OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off.

Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.
"The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary." -- Vince Lombardi
Weakness cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.

Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.

Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
With allies like Egypt and Libya who needs enemies?!
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
I will be speaking Monday September 24 (10 A.M.) at Liberty University to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!
Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
It's Thursday how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?
Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll  http://t.co/yOw3U3ja
.@MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. Obama who put these radicals in power deserves blame.
Welcome to Obama's America--record high poverty and an 8% drop in median household family income http://t.co/3jzUjcnW  Four more years?
Congratulations to Obama and the @DNC. The federal deficit has topped $1T for a fourth year in a row http://t.co/1DK4yTDS  Nice work!
I keep getting great feedback on new #TRUMP cologne 'Success.' Exclusively available at @Macy's http://t.co/8YMD9fQH And best shirts &amp; ties

WOW! I just heard that the previously unknown singer Mac Miller has received over 67 million hits on his song "Donald Trump."
I hate @USAToday's redesign--the logo is terrible. Lightweight Al Neuharth must've had something to do with this No wonder paper is failing.
@BuckingSlams  Sam you're 100% correct. Frankly I wish they'd scram.
@HeinzPak @usatoday That could be. Agreed.

@Josh_Beaupre  Josh--Thanks I think you're right.
@ScottSaia23 Thanks Scott. I appreciate your nice words.
It's amazing--@hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. He is a complete shill for Obama.
Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition? They need it fast.
RT @MittRomney: For nearly 4 years Barack Obama has refused to crack down on China's cheating &amp; American workers have paid the price.
@Steelchecker  Jody--Agreed.
@Shawn_Maynard  This is our 13th season. No precise date yet but most likely in the early spring. Shooting is underway. Will be terrific.
QE3 is going to further sink the dollar into oblivion. Creates artificial numbers for short term market gains. (cont) http://t.co/8mORe86h
No surprise--Obama's Deputy Campaign Manager tweeted link from Chinese propaganda outlet http://t.co/JMgUoRMF Did she also write it?
First Obama says Egypt is not an ally. Then he promises to keep handing over aid  http://t.co/AQVEdKZn   Incompetent and unqualified.
If you want to know how to prevail through tough circumstances then read "The Art of the Comeback."
Hey @KimKardashian--I hear you are undecided in the election. I can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney.
Weekly jobless claims are up once again. The economy cannot recover with Obama in office.
"Success is having to worry about every damn thing in the world except money."--Johnny Cash
Occupy Wall Street is at it again- go out and get a job. It's actually easier work and far more rewarding.
Kate Middleton is great--but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude--only herself to blame.
After being ripped off for years Obama finally figured out that China is taking advantage of us. He's finally listening to me.

Obama is our unlucky President. Everything he touches turns into a mess. Some people just don't have it!
Gas prices have doubled under Obama. Over $5/gallon now in California. We must start drilling from our own resources to become independent.
Teachers in Chicago should go back to work immediately.Rahm Emanuel has offered them a fair deal. Now they're just acting for the cameras.
With 50 days until the election it is #TimeToGetTough for @MittRomney &amp; @GOP
Eli Manning staged a great comeback in 4th quarter--an elite quarterback.
Still a buyer's market. Buy directly from a bank. They want to offload properties that have defaulted will give good prices &amp; financing.
While Obama is denying it he did receive intelligence about the attacks 3 days before http://t.co/u78hfrJt Too busy campaigning?
It's Monday how many more excuses will Obama make today about the economy?
China is now attacking Japan's economy for leverage http://t.co/KFAhowS7  Soon they will try the same with us. #TimeToGetTough

@rdowns I never went bankrupt. Enemies love to say I did. Didn't happen.
Now a small country like Sudan tells Obama he can't send any more Marines http://t.co/kMstNUBH   We are a laughing stock.

This morning @nbc @todayshow played some of the @RNC video I filmed for the Tampa Convention http://t.co/ogglpBfQ
With 49 days until the election @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. He should not be apologizing. Deflect onto Obama's record.
The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran.
It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.
Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.
.@lightjzup  Industrial turbines are destroying our land.
.@RICKYMONEY  I don't know a lot about failures. And as you know I never went bankrupt.

I'll be on @gretawire tonight at 10 PM Fox News
Obama killed over 100k jobs by not approving Keystone XL pipeline and Canada is now selling the oil to China--very dumb!
Filming for @CelebApprentice Season 13 is now into the 2nd week. The 'All-Star' cast is already hard at work.
@RowRee It will be fantastic!
@angela_pink_fan @celebapprentice @bretmichaels Tune in!
@danojano @AFreespeechzone  Dopey--I have never filed for bankruptcy (as you know!)
Obama should play golf with Republicans &amp; opponents rather than his small group of friends. That way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.
The stage is set for the real debate--it will be very interesting!
Technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago.
Oil would be $25 a barrel if our government would let us drill. Our country would be rich again--who needs OPEC.

QE3 a political favor for Obama will cause record inflation on food and fuel.  This hits low income families the hardest. Big mistake.
Isn’t it great that Obama had time yesterday to fundraise with Jay Z and do @Late_Show while there is a record 21% real unemployment!

@Ileschinder @willsommer Not a bad idea.( I'm in a magnanimous mood.)
It is now clear that the Embassy attack in Libya was a coordinated Al Qaeda operation and not based on some video.

Just left Liberty University. Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.&amp; his father have done an amazing job...great school &amp; the students were fantastic
Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records &amp; applications in return?
The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart.
With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
The Emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show!
"Amazing Race" winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows.
The Emmys are all politics that's why despite nominations The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over.
All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race.
Despite all of China's cheating they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!
The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.
With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
