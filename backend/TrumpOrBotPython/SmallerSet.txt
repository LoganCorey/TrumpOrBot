Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk?

While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.

Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline.
The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly.
The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @BarackObama.... 
Obama sadly has no business or private sector background---and it shows.
Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions---cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors.
My thoughts on the situation in Norway and Amanda Knox... 
My interview from yesterday on Fox and Friends -- "GOP Crazy If  They Don't Get Everything They  Want"  
America's debt is greater than our GDP. Time for new thinking.
China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves---US needs our toughest negotiator---and fast!
Higher Taxes kill job creation---cut wild government spending and waste.

My wife Melania Trump's show was a tremendous success last night. In case you missed her you can see her again tonight on @QVC at 7 pm ET

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.
Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems.

Looking forward to the GOP  debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll. We must get a real leader.
How will Mitt Romney defend his  record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate?

Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mike Huckebee a great guy said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy.

@BarackObama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1. Not create any jobs. 2. Borrow more money from China. 
@BarackObama is sure a master delegator. He has sent @Joe_Biden to China. The Chinese are laughing at us. We MUST do better.
Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently. They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens.

We have spent over $1 Billion on the  Libya operation. What are we getting back?
There usually is an easy solution to every problem. For instance a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election.
@BarackObama inherited $10.6 Trillion in National Debt---will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17.6 Trillion.
China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership it can be stopped.
America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People.
I'm very proud of the work my son @EricTrump has been doing with the @EricTrumpFDN take a look... 
Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha's Vineyard? They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime.
There is no substitute for private sector experience.
More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties----I agree.
Hurricane Irene and Libya in today's #trumpvlog.... 
Libyan Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support---we don't even ask!
Iran admits to aiding the Libyan "Rebels" and Ahmadinejad received a letter of thanks - when will Washington learn? 
@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution.
Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off.
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?
If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences.
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses.
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now.
China's business interests reach far and wide---even domestically within our borders. We need to reassess our relationship.

We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel---if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it.
My interview with @gretawire last night -- "Everything Obama Does is a 'Campaign Speech'"  
@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th. Just sad.
Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House.
The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher.
Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @BarackObama should answer all questions.
Oil is double the price now compared to last year--OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama.
Fast and Furious   gun running goes all the way to the White House.  We need answers now!

USA should take oil from Iraq in repayment for their liberation.  
US should have told Libya "Rebels" --- give us 50% of your oil for our military support.
A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare---not cuts on Seniors.
Why was @BarackObama selling guns to Mexican drug dealers?
America needs a tough negotiator---not a community organizer.
My interview with @gretawire last night on @FoxNews:  @BarackObama 'Missed His Opportunity'  
My interview yesterday with @IngrahamAngle  
If only speeches could create jobs then @BarackObama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record.
China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion. @BarackObama is their favorite client.
Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program? The US should look at future funding.
@IvankaTrump always makes me proud    
I watched POTUS speech from Europe---same old "tax and spend" won't create jobs.
@BarackObama---the stimulus will fail just like the first.
Want jobs? Slash corporate tax rate.  Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US.  America will boom.
Very exciting. I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal!
Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary.
The World Economic Forum now ranks the US the fifth most competitive economy in the world. We have fallen from first under @BarackObama.

My thoughts on @andyroddick in today's #trumpvlog.... 
The American economy would grow if Washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations. Government is not the solution.

I'm urging my friends in Brooklyn to vote for Bob Turner tomorrow--send @barackobama a message.

We can create jobs in the American economy by protecting our own manufacturing sector.
I applaud @netanyahu for announcing that he will show up at the UN to defend @Israel. A true US friend and great leader.
@BarackObama -- honored and excited to be listed on @AttackWatch. Thanks. BTW -- where are the jobs?   Donald.

"It  doesn't cost any money to think bigger."  -- The Art of the Deal
My thoughts on the Emmys in today's #trumpvlog.... 
If China had a tenth of the natural resources we do then they would already be energy independent. Instead we continue to buy oil from OPEC.

The OWS protesters are doing nothing to advance the interests of the 99%. Time for them to go home!
My thoughts on Gadhafi's death @BarackObama and the misery index... 
Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security.
The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.
Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy not a friend.
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.

When the Super Committee fails @BarackObama will get exactly what he really wants--automatic cuts in defense spending. This is his plan.
The House's failure to pass the Balance Budget Amendment was another unforced error by the GOP. Very disappointing.

Jennifer Aniston is engaged--she's a great person and I wish her well.
.@Israel could very well be close to attacking Iran. Could be this election's big October surprise...
I always said @BarackObama will attack Iran in some form prior to the election.
Good news - @MittRomney has pulled ahead in Wisconsin  
Palm Springs CA has been destroyed--absolutely destroyed--by the world's ugliest wind farm at the Gateway on Interstate 10. Very very sad!

Great speech on China by @PaulRyanVP yesterday where he explains why China is treating @BarackObama like a "Doormat" 
.@MittRomney &amp; @PaulRyanVP get what needs to be done to reign in China. @BarackObama gets kicked around by the Chinese.
The US government's foreign debt is at a record $5.29T 
US government's foreign indebtedness has grown over 72% under @BarackObama. He is bleeding us dry to China.
If @BarackObama really loved this country he wouldn't be destroying it. He has ruined our credit and killed jobs with ObamaCare.
Congratulations to @bobmcdonnell on leading Virginia to be in the black for a 3rd straight year. He is a fantastic governor.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM--tune in!

Congratulations to @TheSlyStallone and Arnold @Schwarzenegger on 'Expendables 2' #1 box office opening. Still going strong!
Oil is rising back over $100 barrel. OPEC loves to rip us off. Why shouldn't they--they always get away with it.
Americans already believe that @PaulRyanVP is better qualified to serve as  President over @JoeBiden  
Scary thought--@JoeBiden is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Unemployment is up in 44 states showing July's unemployment numbers to be broad based

.@RogerJStoneJr was great on @TheKudlowReport last night. Roger and Larry are good friends!
Amazing--both Transformers &amp; Dark Knight Rises featured Trump properties and each grossed over $1B. Just coincidence.
Every economic climate whether an uptick or downturn presents new opportunities and challenges.
Distressed real estate opportunities can make great investments. You need the foresight and instincts to know the property's true potential.
Glad to hear @BarackObama's attack ad featuring my plane is playing in North Carolina. Free ad time for Trump National in Charlotte!
Only three weeks until the new season of @CelebApprentice begins filming--great all-star cast.
I am tired of @BarackObama talking about @MittRomney's father. Why don't we discuss Barack Obama Sr.!
It's amazing how many people still come up to me to thank me for 'The Art of The Deal.' The book has changed a lot of lives.
Many people will be surprised at what is about to be released concerning @BarackObama's background. I for one won't be.

Gas prices are soaring. $4.12 in CA. OPEC is laughing at how stupid we are.
Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico. @BarackObama can't be bothered he is too concerned with @MittRomney's taxes.
We are about to have a record $500B trade deficit with the Chinese this year. That money should be back here financing jobs in America.

One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @GOP can't be pollitically correct. We must fight fire with fire.
Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend. He was an American hero.
It is very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians.

As usual the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines &amp; ratings!

What a coincidence--Michelle Obama called Kenya @BarackObama's "homeland" in 2008  
China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November. They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama.
An excerpt of my @TheBrodyFile interview at the Sarasota 'Statesman of the Year' dinner discussing the Tea Party 
Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night. America can't wait to call her our First Lady.
My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing the 2012 election OPEC ripping us off &amp; @MittRomney's job policy  
Great speech by my good friend @GovChristie. He did something you won't hear at @BarackObama's convention---tell the truth.

"America needs @MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP and we need them right now." -- @GovChristie
I am astonished that the media continues to lie. @BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!
China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama  
I was putting together my early deals in New York &amp; I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself &amp; you can do anything.
It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?
Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden  
Gas prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand how do OPEC &amp; the speculators get away with this?!
Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year.
Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better.

The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!
"After four  years of getting the run-around America needs a turnaround and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney." @PaulRyanVP
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
Too busy playing golf? @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic  signature to the parents of fallen SEALs   
Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment.
Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it.
A fact--golfers don't get aches &amp; pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial.
It's Friday how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today?
Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @BarackObama could have stopped this.

If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!
I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad...leave Clint alone!
Great going Andy Roddick! Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck.
As I predicted 1 year ago gasoline prices hit a record high today...OPEC is having a ball at our expense.
"Be  yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected." -- Steve Jobs
Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report.
Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
Is this Hope &amp; Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs &amp; trade during @BarackObama's term.
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.
No surprise. @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans 
Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!
.@lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance.
Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon @lancearmstrong for events that took place years ago in France?

I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now.
North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte.
Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136260 per household a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts etc.
The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good!
Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte? Did he bring his phone with him?
"Change before you have to." --Jack Welch
Other networks are begging me to do a show--I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice!
Once again under@BarackObama the US has fallen down the ranks of global competitiveness  
Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him. Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama?
Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace. Thank you United States for making this possible!
"Donald Trump Has Given Millions To Pro-Romney SuperPACs and His Whole Family Is Cutting Checks to Mitt's Campaign"  
.@BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the convention 
Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.
The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years." Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip 
"Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He's added 15 million people." --@MittRomney
"We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion" -- @MittRomney
Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt.
Under @BarackObama 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps.
The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants @GiulianaRancic and me singing "Call Me Maybe"  
The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia. He will take votes away from @MittRomney.
Dems had a very good and professional convention. The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast!
Drew Peterson a real sleaze just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty.
Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88921000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
There are now 119000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.
Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force &amp; have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery phony numbers
This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is: 
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%
A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence go with your gut!
During @BarackObama's presidency median family income has fallen 4.8% 
One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom. But I used the downturn to my advantage.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM. Tune in!
"You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something sometime in your life." -- Winston Churchill

"President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people"--Clint Eastwood
Barack Obama used to mock Bush's 300K monthly job reports 
Why has Barack Obama repeatedly told inconsistent stories about his religious background?  
"You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals."--General George S. Patton
Obama called August's job report "progress." Overall 96K new jobs &amp; over 173K new people on food stamps
Today we remember and honor our fellow Americans and NYPD and FDNY who fell 11 years ago.
An impromptu interview I did with German TV on 9/11 down by Ground Zero discussing the attack and WTC Towers 
Discussing the 9/11 attack and coverage with @kingsthings while hosting the 25th anniversary of his @CNN show  
My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview with Ken Langone &amp; Dick Grasso discussing the Chicago teachers' strike @ 2012  
"Trump: If Republicans 'don't get tough they're not going to win this election'" 
On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger.
The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers &amp; their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
84% of US troops wounded &amp; 70% of our brave men &amp; women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?
China is an international pariah. They are now harassing Japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands  
Priorities--while fundraising and campaigning on our dime Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefings  
Amazing. @CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base.
"If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party." -- @limbaugh
"There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare." -- Sun Tzu
I hope the @GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won't be with them next time.
Why is the Pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green.' Complete waste. We need the best &amp; easiest fuel for our military.
When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election? The day after.
We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans. Obama's foreign policy is a joke.
An attack on our Embassy is an attack on our soil. We have been attacked by Libya. Go into Libya &amp; take the (cont) 
Obama doesn't know what he's doing. His foreign policy is a disaster. Libya Egypt Iraq Afghanistan--all (cont) 
I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again I was right.
Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe.
Obama is a disaster at foreign policy. Never had the experience or knowledge. He is not capable of doing the job.
The Middle East is blowing up--we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us. Iran is using Iraqi airspace (cont) 
As bad as they were I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power.
What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil.
It's Wednesday how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?
OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off.
So Obama can host the Muslim Brotherhood Pres. Morsi in the White House 
"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic (cont) 
Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.
No surprise. @DNC displayed Russian ships in tribute to vets 
"Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel." -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu
I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.
"The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary." -- Vince Lombardi
Weakness cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.
This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President.
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble.
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.
With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food.
Romney’s campaign is being put on the defensive. He cannot let this happen. Stop pandering. Must get tougher (cont) 
If Obama was smart he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month. He won't.
Wake Up America!  See article: "Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake" 
Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started. Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates.
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
With allies like Egypt and Libya who needs enemies?!
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
I will be speaking Monday September 24 (10 A.M.) at Liberty University to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!
Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
It's Thursday how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?
Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll  
.@MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. Obama who put these radicals in power deserves blame.
Welcome to Obama's America--record high poverty and an 8% drop in median household family income 
Congratulations to Obama and the @DNC. The federal deficit has topped $1T for a fourth year in a row 
I keep getting great feedback on new #TRUMP cologne 'Success.' Exclusively available at @Macy's

I hate @USAToday's redesign--the logo is terrible. Lightweight Al Neuharth must've had something to do with this No wonder paper is failing.
@BuckingSlams  Sam you're 100% correct. Frankly I wish they'd scram.
@HeinzPak @usatoday That could be. Agreed.
Oh no another rapper doing a Trump song --"Young Jeezy - Trump Lyrics." Why aren't these guys paying me?

@MaryEnglish67 @USAToday  Sometimes that's necessary.
@Josh_Beaupre  Josh--Thanks I think you're right.
@ScottSaia23 Thanks Scott. I appreciate your nice words.
It's amazing--@hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. He is a complete shill for Obama.
Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition? They need it fast.
RT @MittRomney: For nearly 4 years Barack Obama has refused to crack down on China's cheating &amp; American workers have paid the price.
@Steelchecker  Jody--Agreed.
@Shawn_Maynard  This is our 13th season. No precise date yet but most likely in the early spring. Shooting is underway. Will be terrific.
QE3 is going to further sink the dollar into oblivion. Creates artificial numbers for short term market gains. (cont) 
No surprise--Obama's Deputy Campaign Manager tweeted link from Chinese propaganda outlet 
First Obama says Egypt is not an ally. Then he promises to keep handing over aid  
If you want to know how to prevail through tough circumstances then read "The Art of the Comeback."
Hey @KimKardashian--I hear you are undecided in the election. I can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney.
Weekly jobless claims are up once again. The economy cannot recover with Obama in office.
"Success is having to worry about every damn thing in the world except money."--Johnny Cash
Occupy Wall Street is at it again- go out and get a job. It's actually easier work and far more rewarding.
Kate Middleton is great--but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude--only herself to blame.
After being ripped off for years Obama finally figured out that China is taking advantage of us. He's finally listening to me.
Via @digitaljournal: "Donald Trump tweets Obama is 'an incompetent President'" 
"Trump: If Republicans 'don't get tough they're not going to win this election'" 
Obama is our unlucky President. Everything he touches turns into a mess. Some people just don't have it!
Gas prices have doubled under Obama. Over $5/gallon now in California. We must start drilling from our own resources to become independent.
Teachers in Chicago should go back to work immediately.Rahm Emanuel has offered them a fair deal. Now they're just acting for the cameras.
With 50 days until the election it is #TimeToGetTough for @MittRomney &amp; @GOP
Eli Manning staged a great comeback in 4th quarter--an elite quarterback.
Still a buyer's market. Buy directly from a bank. They want to offload properties that have defaulted will give good prices &amp; financing.
While Obama is denying it he did receive intelligence about the attacks 3 days before 
It's Monday how many more excuses will Obama make today about the economy?
China is now attacking Japan's economy for leverage

I'll be at Liberty University Monday 10 AM for speech. Looking forward to meeting students--all sold out!
At the National Achievers Congress in London this October I'm going to talk about success and how to avoid failure  
@rdowns I never went bankrupt. Enemies love to say I did. Didn't happen.
Now a small country like Sudan tells Obama he can't send any more Marines 
@princeetornam They had both interest and aptitude. They've done a terrific job.
My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing QE3 @MittRomney's leaked comments Middle East &amp; US oil capability 
My @nbc @todayshow interview discussing my @RNC video &amp; why @MittRomney should not apologize 
This morning @nbc @todayshow played some of the @RNC video I filmed for the Tampa Convention 
With 49 days until the election @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. He should not be apologizing. Deflect onto Obama's record.
The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran.
It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.
Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.
.@lightjzup  Industrial turbines are destroying our land.
.@RICKYMONEY  I don't know a lot about failures. And as you know I never went bankrupt.
Can you believe--they are blaming @MittRomney for Egypt.
Our soldiers can't even have any more joint exercises with Afghan soldiers because they are getting shot in the (cont) 
I'll be on @gretawire tonight at 10 PM Fox News
Obama killed over 100k jobs by not approving Keystone XL pipeline and Canada is now selling the oil to China--very dumb!
Filming for @CelebApprentice Season 13 is now into the 2nd week. The 'All-Star' cast is already hard at work.
@RowRee It will be fantastic!
@angela_pink_fan @celebapprentice @bretmichaels Tune in!
@danojano @AFreespeechzone  Dopey--I have never filed for bankruptcy (as you know!)
Obama should play golf with Republicans &amp; opponents rather than his small group of friends. That way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.
The stage is set for the real debate--it will be very interesting!
Technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago.
Oil would be $25 a barrel if our government would let us drill. Our country would be rich again--who needs OPEC.
My @gretawire interview  
Via @washingtonpost: "The Donald's video should have trumped Eastwood" by @CapehartJ  
Don't let them build a wind turbine in your backyard (or near your house). It will destroy your property value.
China has been unfairly subsidizing the export of cars &amp; auto parts. I've been saying this for 3 years...
...come down hard--tax the hell out of their imports and reduce our deficit fast.
Via @Newsmax_Media: "Romney Said Nothing Wrong" 
"Trump: Obama is 'Unlucky President'" 
Have you seen the new #Trump fall collection exclusively available @Macys? Top selling brand nationwide.Ties shirts fragrance-great gifts.
QE3 a political favor for Obama will cause record inflation on food and fuel.  This hits low income families the hardest. Big mistake.
Isn’t it great that Obama had time yesterday to fundraise with Jay Z and do @Late_Show while there is a record 21% real unemployment!
To be successful never give up. My secrets to success will be shared at the National Achievers Congress in London. 
Great article by Chris Ruddy @Newsmax_Media: "@AnnDRomney and Jackie's Example"

Now every time Islamic militants attack they will use that movie as an excuse 
@JesseStroup  Nice to hear--and good luck!
@murekar Thanks and we will keep you posted.
@Ileschinder @willsommer Not a bad idea.( I'm in a magnanimous mood.)
It is now clear that the Embassy attack in Libya was a coordinated Al Qaeda operation and not based on some video.
Obama's Def. Sec. just said US Asia focus 'not aimed to contain China'

I really like Chelsea Clinton--an amazing young woman. She got the best of both parents. (@IvankaTrump agrees)

@susanvhinds  A happy and healthy family.
At the Univision forum Obama continued to make excuses for Fast and Furious 
I have fun I love what I do. You should too. Find out how at the National Achievers Conference this October. 
Rising premium costs from Obamacare will cost businesses billions

No matter how diligent you are in evaluating a business deal there is invariably one factor you have no control over--luck...

@jtatsuno  It's real.
A letter from an amazing woman 
A letter written to one of my many critics! 
The Ryder Cup will be amazing this week.
Just left Liberty University. Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.&amp; his father have done an amazing job...great school &amp; the students were fantastic
Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records &amp; applications in return?
The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart.
With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
The Emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show!
"Amazing Race" winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows.
The Emmys are all politics that's why despite nominations The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over.
All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race.
Despite all of China's cheating they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!
The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.
With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
RT @MittRomney: I am running for president to get us creating wealth again--not to redistribute it.
Today I spoke @LibertyU Convocation a great crowd...
Scary--Obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends.
Living in denial--only 15% of Democrats think that recent economic news is poor 
Secure your place at the National Achievers Congress in London. It will be an amazing event with a great surprise. 
The debates are going to have a big impact on the election. @MittRomney has proved--in Florida--he delivers under pressure.
Home values have sunk a record 15% under Obama.
Coincidence? Obama and Ahmadinejad each describe @Israel's warning over the Iranian nuclear program as just 'noise' 
Muslim Brotherhood head of Egypt Morsi is already making demands on Obama before the WH visit. Obama's foreign policy is a complete failure.

One 57 is one of the worst looking buildings I've seen in a long time in particular its very ugly "skin."
The replacement refs are getting blamed for everything. I've seen many bad sports calls over the years.
Did a shoot in front of the Metropolitian Museum on 5th Ave for the 13th season of the Apprentice...
...well into our 4th week of shooting the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice. The 'All Stars' are hard at work...
...yet not one meeting with an ally (or an enemy!) Where's the media?
Obama will be going on @theviewtv &amp; fundraising while in NYC for the UN Assembly...
The 18th hole at the Blue Monster @Doral in Miami is considered the toughest finishing hole in golf...

"Selfishness ultimately begets only unhappiness. Unselfishness begets happiness."  -- B.C. Forbes
The number of unemployed Americans has increased over 60% during Obama's term. The economy can't survive another 4 years.
English taxpayers should stop subsidizing the destruction of Scotland by paying massive subsidies for ugly wind turbines.
Andy Williams has died. He was a friend of mine and a great guy.
.@brandonhardest  Love what you do and work hard.
Obama's new excuse for his failures is that you "can't change Washington from the inside." Not what he said in '09. 
Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility.
Aspirin gets the best press of almost anything I can think of---fact or great PR?
.@Matt_Berry87  Piers did a great job--the interview was very important.

China has done very well under Obama. Now they just released their first aircraft carrier.
No matter how good the replacement refs do they will be soundly criticized--they can't win!
Huff post gets it wrong re: Ferry Point...the only leakage of gas is from Arianna Huffington.
Associated Press knowingly and inaccurately wrote about Liberty University speech. Shameful reporting...no credibility.
Liberty University speech by DJT was biggest by far in school's history. Standing ovations...great young people!
Jerry Falwell Jr. stated speech was best in University's history...my great honor.

40 days until the election. Crunch time. @MittRomney must stay on offense and take the fight to Obama.
Congratulations to my friend David Wright of the @mets who is now their all-time hitting leader.

A resort in Arizona is using sewage to make snow. Environmentalists are going crazy--I won't be skiing in that snow.
Now Obama's campaign is guaranteeing 12 million new jobs during a 2nd term 
ObamaCare is a failure. Costs are rising much faster under Obama than other Presidents.
China's Financial Institutions are expanding overseas.
